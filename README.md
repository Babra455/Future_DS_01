The project "Exploring the Titanic dataset with Cleaning & EDA" is my first project as an intern with Future Interns. The project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset using Python in an Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.

The first step in the project is data cleaning, where I cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing irrelevant or duplicate data, and converting categorical variables into numerical variables. I also checked for any inconsistencies in the data and addressed them accordingly.

The second step is exploratory data analysis (EDA), where I used various techniques such as cross-tabulations, histograms, and box plots to uncover insights about the passengers aboard the Titanic.Analyzed the distribution of various features such as age, gender, class, and fare, and looked for any patterns or trends in the data.

During the EDA, my insights about the passengers aboard the Titanic. For example, the I found that the survival rate was significantly lower for passengers in the third class compared to the first and second classes. Furthermore I also found that the survival rate was higher for passengers who embarked on the Titanic from Southampton compared to other cities.

I also used the pandas library to visualize the distribution of the various features in the dataset ; created various plots such as bar plots, line plots, and scatter plots to visualize the data and gain insights into the patterns and trends in the data.

Overall, the project aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of the Titanic dataset and uncover insights about the passengers aboard the Titanic. The project also provided hands-on experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis using Python and the pandas library.
